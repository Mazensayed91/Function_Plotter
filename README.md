# Function_Plotter

### Dependencies:
  Python : 3.7.3
  numpy : 1.16.4
  matplotlib : 3.1.0
  re : 2.2.1
  pyqt : 5
  
  
### How To Run:
  download the three .py files in the repo and run gui.py, so a gui application will run and you'll be asked to enter a valid function, minimim x value and maximum x value
  then press "OK" and a matplotlib figure will appear with the function plotted.
  
### Limitations:
  The plotter plots only a function with the following operators : "+" , "-" , "\*" , "/" + "^"
  more functions to be added soon (sin-cos-...).
